  <h1>Some Helpful Hints While Staying</h1>

  <h2>PLEASE be careful for this</h2>
  <p>One summer I was working in the front house, and left the toilet running for two weeks. Sandra and I nearly had to sell the places to pay the water bill. So please be sure the toilets aren't running when you leave (I try to make that not happen by keeping them in good repair, but ...) and be sure the kitchen faucet in the back house if physically off, not just "waved" off.</p>

  <h2>Tips, Tricks and Traps</h2>
  <p>BE CAREFUL of the faucet in the tub in the back house. Someone (not me) installed the valve backwards and the hot is cold and the cold is hot. I will fix this someday.</p>

  <h2>Check Your Tires</h2>
  <p>In the mud room, in the bottom-right drawer, is a nice electric tire pump. The batteries for which are in the top-right drawer. You can just turn it on, set the pressure you want, and set it to go. It turns off automatically.</p>

  <h2>Need a jump start?</h2>
  <p>Also in the bottom drawer is a NOCO Car Battery Booster Pack. I charge it when I leave, so hopefully if you need it the battery has enough umpf to get you going. Fingers crossed it is never needed (Sandra and I did once).</p>
