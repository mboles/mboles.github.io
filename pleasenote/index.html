  <h2>PLEASE be careful for this</h2>
  <p>One summer I was working in the front house, and left the toilet running for two weeks. Sandra and I nearly had to sell the places to pay the water bill. So please be sure the toilets aren't running (I try to make that not happen by keeping them in good repair, but ...) and be sure the kitchen faucet in the back house if physically off, not just "waved" off.</p>
