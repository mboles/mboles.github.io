  <h1>Finding Food</h1>

  <p>When Sandra and I go out to eat we are NOT trying to eat healthy. We can eat healthy and delicious at home (thanks Sandra!), so the recommendations here are not for grilled chicken breast and steamed veggies (not that I would ever want to eat that).</p>

  <p>If cooking at the house, there is the small grocery store in Yachats, but the biggest grocery store that is close is the Rays Food Place in Waldport (580 NE Broadway, NE Commercial St, Waldport, OR 97394). For big grocery shopping trips, and good produce, visit one of the Fred Meyer stores in Newport or Florence.</p>


  <h2>Yachats - for such a dinky town, pretty good eating actually</h2>
  <h3>Yachats Brewing</h3>
  <p>348 US-101, Yachats, OR 97498</p>

  <p>Nice place for a meal. Interesting brews and food. Very seasonal so if you’ve eaten here more than a couple of months earlier, chances are the menu will have changed.</p>


  <h3>The Drift Inn</h3>
  <p>124 US-101, Yachats, OR 97498</p>

  <p>Nice meals here. Sandra and I always enjoy the visit.</p>


  <h3>Luna Sea Fish House</h3>
  <p>153 US-101, Yachats, OR 97498</p>

  <p>Really good fish and chips, but a bit on the pricey side for the size of the portion. Lots of different kinds of fish you can choose from. The blackberry cobbler (seasonal) was really good.</p>


  <h3>Bread & Roses Bakery</h3>
  <p>238 4th St, Yachats, OR 97498</p>

  <p>Gets great reviews, but Sandra and I thought it a bit expensive and pastries just OK. Looking for a bakery treat, definitely Pacific Sourdough Bakery (Waldport, see below) is the place to go.</p>


  <h3>The Village Bean</h3>
  <p>969 US-101, Yachats, OR 97498</p>

  <p>A tiny drive up coffee place. VERY easy walk from the house, and the help there has always been very friendly. The pastries are very good. Been told they are home made from someone in Waldport. Right next to the Dollar General on 101. Sandra's favorite is the blended Sea Turtle.</p>


  <h3>Green Salmon Coffee House</h3>
  <p>220 US-101, Yachats, OR 97498</p>

  <p>Plan on getting up early as this place is always packed. Never been as neither Sandra nor I real coffee drinkers, so not worth the wait. Been told it has the old "Oregon Hippie" feel.</p>


  <h3>LeRoy's Blue Whale</h3>
  <p>580 Hwy 101 N, Yachats, OR 97498</p>
  <p>Used to be our go to breakfast place, but seems like prices have gotten kind of high for what you get. They do have good pies and fish and chips).</p>


  <h3>Ona Restaurant & Lounge</h3>
  <p>131 US-101, Yachats, OR 97498</p>

  <p>The fanciest place in town, or so we have been told. It also seems to be the most expensive when looking at the menu. Sandra and I have never been in.</p>


  <h3>Adobe Restaurant and Lounge</h3>
  <p>1555 Hwy 101 N, Yachats, OR 97498</p>
  <p>Used to have a pretty good Sunday brunch, but haven’t been in ages. Never eaten other meals there. There is a great bar where you can go upstairs in the bar and watch the waves coming in. No wait staff comes upstairs so you can get your drinks at the bar, get some free popcorn, and sit and enjoy for as long as you want without being disturbed.</p>


  <h3>Outta Gas Pizza</h3>
  <p>1685 Hwy 101 N, Yachats, OR 97498</p>
  <p>Terrible pizza, you would be much better off buying a fancy frozen one from the store and baking it yourself. Gets good reviews, but I don’t get it. If you get a hankering for pizza, see Grand Central Pizza in Waldport (below).</p>



  <h2>Waldport</h2>
  <h3>Lazy Dayz Cafe</h3>
  <p>1240 Northeast Mill Street, Waldport, OR 97394</p>

  <p>On the waterfront and kind of hard to find. I like BBQ, and the brisket sandwich one of the best I have ever had. Huge sandwich, so one could probably feed two people, but on the other hand can’t beat leftover bbq. Good to take home as the sandwich, slaw and beans all travel well. No fries to get soggy. Pulled pork sandwich also good, but brisket stood out. Fish and chips quite good here also.</p>

  <h3>Chubby’s Burger Food Truck VERY SADLY THIS CLOSED</h3>
  <p>115 SW Hwy 101, Waldport, OR 97394</p>

  <p>Right on 101 in Waldport, a food truck, with a couple of picnic tables if you have the desire to sit in the rain while you have your great burger. REALLY good burgers made from beef the owners raise up the Alsea River. Our favorites are the bacon cheeseburger and BBQ burger. If you are a hot dog person, which I am not, but Sandra thought the Chubby Dog sounded good but was disappointed. I had the chili cheeseburger once, but it was too much chili and couldn’t eat it like a burger.</p>


  <h3>Pacific Sourdough Bakery</h3>
  <p>740 Northeast Mill Street, Waldport, OR 97394</p>
  <p>Caution: Only open Thursday - Saturday to the public. From what I have heard and asked they supply bread and bakery items to LOTS of restaurants in Yachats/Waldport the other days.</p>

  <p>Just about everything is good we have tried, including the breads and sweet items. So go in and pick out your favs and don’t worry about calories.</p>


  <h3>Hilltop Cafe Bistro</h3>
  <p>828 SW Pacific Coast Hwy, Waldport, OR 97394</p>

  <p>Have only eaten breakfast here, and then only once. It was very good and the menu looked interesting for other meals.</p>


  <h3>Grand Central Pizza</h3>
  <p>245 SW Hwy 101, Waldport, OR 97394</p>

  <p>Ordered take out pizza here many more times than we should have. Good pizza & the garlic rolls are really good too.</p>
