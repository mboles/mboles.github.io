  <h2>804 Trail</h2>
	<p>To walk off some of the food you can use the 804 trail. Walk down Marine Drive and youâ€™ll see a little sign for the trail and a gravel path that cuts through an empty lot, heading north. The house where you turn right (north) has a big mural with Indian pictures/motif. Once you get to the next street head towards the ocean. There are small signs for directions, but you have to look for them. There is a little trail next to a house through which you walk to the water. You walk along the rocks until you hit the sandy beach, then sand all the way to Waldport if you want a really good hike. </p>
