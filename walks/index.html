  <h1>Walks and Hikes</h1>
  <h2>Watch a Sunset</h2>
  <p>This is the shortest way to an unobstructed view of the ocean. Great to watch a sunset or whale watching. (Two minute, thrill packed video.)</p>

  <h2>804 Trail</h2>
  <p>To walk off some of the food you can use the 804 trail. Walk down Marine Drive and youâ€™ll see a little sign for the trail and a gravel path that cuts through an empty lot, heading north. The house where you turn right (north) has a big mural with Indian pictures/motif. Once you get to the next street head towards the ocean. There are small signs for directions, but you have to look for them. There is a little trail next to a house through which you walk to the water. You walk along the rocks until you hit the sandy beach, then sand all the way to Waldport if you want a really good hike. </p>

  <h2>Drive South for Some Great Scenery and the Hobbit Trail</h2>

  <p>To hike up and around the lighthouse you can stop along 101 and hike the Hobbit Trail. Very popular so parking can be an issue. Best to go early.</p>
